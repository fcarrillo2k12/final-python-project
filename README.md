This is a GUI created using python and tkinter. From a database file it reads a list of products and their prices. The program then uses the 
db file to populate the store with the items. The user is then able to select what products they would like to buy and add them to their cart.
Once added the program will show their total and allow the user to buy the items. User can also delete items from their cart. You can test can
add and delete items from the inventory by editing the db file.
